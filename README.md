# Sports Result Notifier

## Requirements  
- [x] This is an application where you should read sports data from a website once a day and send it to a specific e-mail address.
- [x] You don't need any interaction with the program. It will be a service that runs automatically.
- [x] The data should be collected from the Basketball Reference Website in the resources area.
- [x] You should use the Agility Pack library for scrapping.

## What I learnt
* Sending emails - the ability to send e-mails programmatically.
* Web Scraping - the ability to harvest data from non-api sources.
